# MLB-income-pooling
This repo contains the data used to analyze income pools in professional baseball, along with the code used to scrape the data.

Within the data, we consider all Minor league players in the year 2000 and compute their total career earnings to date. If a player has negative salary, this indicates that they were in the Major league prior to the year 2000, and we subsequently remove them from the analysis.
